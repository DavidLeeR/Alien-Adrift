**Description:**
This is a command line game that pits you against aliens (from the Aliens Franchise). You must survive long enough for help to arrive to your space ship. The map contains 5 rooms with 3 craftable items. You have an inventory and health. The alien enemies move randomly throughout the map, so each new playthrough is different. All instructions for play are included when the game is started.
